This AdBlocker is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to block intrusive ads and tracking scripts on web pages. It blocks ad-serving network requests and removes ad elements directly from the page, ensuring a cleaner and faster browsing experience.

How It Works

This AdBlocker uses two main approaches to block ads:

    Network-level Blocking (via declarativeNetRequest):
        Blocks requests to ad servers (e.g., ads, doubleclick, googlesyndication) before they load.

    Content Script Removal:
        Injects a script (content.js) to remove ad elements from the DOM.
        Blocks inline JavaScript functions that display ads.

Files Overview
manifest.json

Defines the extension configuration:

    Permissions to block network requests and modify content on web pages.
    Specifies the background service worker (background.js) and the content script (content.js).

background.js

Applies blocking rules using the declarativeNetRequest API to stop network requests matching common ad-related patterns.
content.js

    Removes ad-related elements using CSS selectors.
    Observes page changes with a MutationObserver to dynamically remove ads.
    Blocks inline ad-displaying functions like showAds().

        Ad elements are removed from the DOM.
